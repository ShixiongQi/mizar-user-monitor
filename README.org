* First step: Setup dependencies

Before you can start completing step in this tutorial, you will need to
install a few dependencies on your system. These are described in
[[file:setup_dependencies.org]].

We also provide a helper script that will set up a test environment with
virtual interfaces for you to test your code on. This is introduced in the
basic lessons, and also has [[file:testenv/README.org][it's own README file]].
